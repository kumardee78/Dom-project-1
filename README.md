This repository contains code demonstrating how to dynamically change the style of a <div> element using JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM). Below are instructions on how to achieve this:

* Create the Directory: **DOM project-1**

* Navigate to the Directory: DOM project-1

* Create a HTML file: **index.html**

* Open the index.html file in your preferred code editor.

* Understand the Structure:
The HTML file contains a div element with an id of textDiv. This is the element whose style we will be manipulating dynamically using JavaScript.

* Create script tag : it's just above closing tag of body, you will write JavaScript code how to manipulate the style of the div element. Manipulate the div Styles:

## Here's a breakdown of what you can do:

* Adjust Padding: Use style.padding.
* Change Font Size: Use style.fontSize.
* Change Font Weight: Use style.fontWeight.
* Adjust Height: Use style.height.

Modify the JavaScript code according to your requirements, and save the file.
